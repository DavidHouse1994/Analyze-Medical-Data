# Analyzing Medical Data

## Project Description: 

In this project, you will analyze medical data using numpy arrays. You will use numpy to load and manipulate data from a CSV file containing medical information such as patient age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.

## Steps to Follow:

    Download the medical data CSV file.
    Load the data into a numpy array using the numpy.loadtxt() function.
    Use numpy to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of patient ages, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
    Create a new numpy array containing only the data for patients with a certain medical condition, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.
    Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the patient data for the medical condition.
    Use numpy to create a histogram of patient ages, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
    Use numpy to create a scatter plot of patient blood pressure vs. cholesterol levels.
    Write a report summarizing your findings.

## Skills to Learn:

    Loading data into numpy arrays
    Manipulating numpy arrays
